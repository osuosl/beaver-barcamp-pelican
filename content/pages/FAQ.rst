What will the session topics be?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At Beaver BarCamp, the majority of sessions are not prearranged. Attendees at
each BarCamp propose their own session ideas on the day of the event, and the
schedules are updated throughout  the day to make sure the most popular sessions
get the largest rooms.


Does BarCamp have something to do with bars and alcohol?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No, it doesn't. Its actually a hacker reference to FooBar which is typically
used as a placeholder name when describing something in software code. BarCamp
arose as an open to the public alternative to Foo Camp, which is an
invitation-only conference.
