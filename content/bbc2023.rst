Hello everyone,

I'm pleased to announce that Beaver BarCamp is coming back on April 22, 2023! This year will be a little different for
a variety of reasons:

- No lunch or shirts will be provided
- Limited drink and snack services `will` be provided

These changes were made to reduce cost and complexity of our administrative staff of getting this event going. We feel
it's more important to have an event than to coordinate food, t-shirts and fund raising.

We hope to see you in a month and a half!
