Hello everyone,

Unfortunately, we are cancelling Beaver Barcamp 20 in compliance with the State of Oregon and Oregon State University's
recommendations surrounding gatherings such as ours. Given the nature of our event, we do not feel that it would be
conducive to hold it via videoconferencing, so any funds that were raised for this event will be held over and used for
next year's Barcamp.

We genuinely appreciate all of your support. Please take care of yourselves, and we look forward to seeing you next
year!
